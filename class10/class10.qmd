## 1. The PDB database

Them main repository of biomolecular structure data is called the PDB found at: https://www.rcsb.org

Let's see what this database contains. I went to PDB > Analyze > PDB Statistics > By Exp method and molecular type.

```{r}
pdbstats <- read.csv("Data Export Summary.csv")
pdbstats
```

> Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy.

```{r}
pdbstats$X.ray
```
The comma in these numbers is causing them to be read as character rather than numeric.

I can fix this by replacing "," for nothing "" with the `sub()` function:

```{r}
x <- pdbstats$X.ray
sum( as.numeric( sub(",","", x) ))
```

Or I can use the **readr** package and the `read_csv()` function.

```{r}
library(readr)
pdbstats <- read_csv("Data Export Summary.csv")
pdbstats
```

I want to clean the column names so thay are all lower case and don't have spaces in them

```{r}
colnames(pdbstats)
```
```{r}
library(janitor)

df <- clean_names(pdbstats)
df
```
Total number of X-ray structures
```{r}
sum(df$x_ray)
```
Total number of structures
```{r}
sum(df$total)
```

Percent of X-ray structures
```{r}
sum(df$x_ray)/sum(df$total) * 100
```
Percent of EM structures
```{r}
# You do it!
```


> Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?



## 2. Using Mol*

The main Mol* homepage at: https://molstar.org/viewer/ 
We can input our own PDB files or just give it a PDB database accession code (4 letter PDB code).

> Q5: There is a critical “conserved” water molecule in the binding site. Can you identify this water molecule? What residue number does this water molecule have

![Water 308 in the binding site](1HSG-1.png)


> Q6: Generate and save a figure clearly showing the two distinct chains of HIV-protease along with the ligand. You might also consider showing the catalytic residues ASP 25 in each chain and the critical water (we recommend “Ball & Stick” for these side-chains). Add this figure to your Quarto document.

## 3. Introduction to Bio3D in R

We can use the **bio3d** package for structural bioinformatics to read PDB data into R

```{r}
library(bio3d)

pdb <- read.pdb("1hsg")
pdb
```


> Q7: How many amino acid residues are there in this pdb object? 

```{r}
length( pdbseq(pdb) )
```

> Q8: Name one of the two non-protein residues? 

MK1

> Q9: How many protein chains are in this structure? 

2 chains A and B


Looking at the `pdb` object in more detail

```{r}
attributes(pdb)
```


```{r}
head(pdb$atom)
```

Let's try a new function not yet in the bio3d package. It requires the **r3dmol** package that we need to install with `install.packages("r3dmol")` and `install.packages("shiny")`

```{r}
library(r3dmol)
source("https://tinyurl.com/viewpdb")
#view.pdb(pdb, backgroundColor = "pink
  
```

## 4. Predicting functional dynamics

We can use the `nma()` function in bio3d to predict the large-scale functional motions of biomolecules.

```{r}
adk <- read.pdb("6s36")
adk
```

```{r}
m <- nma(adk)
plot(m)
```
Write out a trajectory of the predicted molecular motion:
```{r}
mktrj(m, file="adk_m7.pdb")
```

```{r}
p <- read.pdb("adk_m7.pdb")


m2 <- r3dmol() |> 
  m_add_model(m_bio3d(p)) |> 
   m_set_style(
    style = c(
      m_style_stick(),
      m_style_sphere(scale = 0.3)
    )) |>
  #m_set_style(style = m_style_cartoon()) |>
  m_zoom_to()

m2

```
