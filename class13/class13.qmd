Today we will analyze data from a published RNA-seq experiment where airway smooth muscle cells were treated with dexamethasone, a synthetic glucocorticoid steroid with anti-inflammatory effects (Himes et al. 2014).

## Import countData and colData

There are two datasets I need to import/read

- `countData` the transcript counts per gene (rows) in the different experiments
- `colData` information (a.k.a. metadata) about the colums (i.e. experiments) in `countData`.

```{r}
counts   <- read.csv("airway_scaledcounts.csv", row.names=1)
metadata <- read.csv("airway_metadata.csv")
```

We can have a wee peak at these with `head()`

```{r}
head(counts)
```

```{r}
metadata
```

> Q1. How many genes are in this dataset?

```{r}
nrow(counts)
```

> Q2. How many ‘control’ cell lines do we have?

```{r}
table( metadata$dex )
```
```{r}
sum( metadata$dex == "control" )
```

We can find the average (mean) count values per gene for all "control" experiments and compare it to the mean values for "treated".

- Extract all "control" columns from the `counts` data
- Find the mean value for each gene in these columns

```{r}
control.inds <- metadata$dex == "control"
control.counts <- counts[ , control.inds]
```

```{r}
dim(control.counts)
```
Now find the row wise mean

```{r}
control.mean <- rowSums(control.counts)/ncol(control.counts)
head(control.mean)
```

```{r}
treated.inds <- metadata$dex == "treated"
treated.counts <- counts[,treated.inds]
treated.mean <- apply(treated.counts, 1, mean)
head(treated.mean)

```
Let's put these two mean values together for easy book-keeping

```{r}
meancounts <- data.frame(control.mean, treated.mean)
head(meancounts)
```

Let's have a wee look - i.e. plot control.mean vs treated.mean

```{r}
plot(meancounts)
```

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(meancounts) +
  aes(control.mean, treated.mean) +
  geom_point(alpha=0.3)
```

Whenever we see data that is so heavly skewed like this we often log transform it so we can see what is going on more easily.

```{r}
plot(meancounts, log="xy")
```

We most often work in log2 units as this makes the math easier. Let's have a play to see this

```{r}
# treated / control
log2(20/20)
```

```{r}
log2(40/20)
```
```{r}
log2(80/20)
```

```{r}
# treated/control
log2(20/40)
```

We can now add "log2 fold-change" values to our `meancounts` dataset.

```{r}
meancounts$log2fc <- log2(meancounts$treated.mean /
                          meancounts$control.mean )

head(meancounts)
```

We need to filter out zero count genes - i.e remove the rows (genes) that have a 0 value in either control or treated means.

```{r}
to.keep <- rowSums( meancounts[,1:2] == 0 ) == 0
mycounts <- meancounts[to.keep,]
nrow(mycounts)
```


How many genes are "up" regulated at the common log2 fold-change threshold of +2.

```{r}
up.inds <- mycounts$log2fc >= 2
sum(up.inds, na.rm=T)
```
How many genes are "down" regulated at the threshold of -2?

```{r}
down.inds <- mycounts$log2fc <= -2
sum(down.inds, na.rm=T)
```

## DESeq2 analysis

To do this the right way we need to consider the significance of the differences not just their magnitute.

```{r}
#| message: false
library(DESeq2)
```

To use this package it wants countData and colData in a specific format.

```{r}
dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = counts,
                              colData = metadata,
                              design = ~dex)
```

```{r}
dds <- DESeq(dds)
```

Extract my results
```{r}
res <- results(dds)
head(res)
```

Plot of fold-change vs P-value (adjusted for mutiple testing)
```{r}
plot(res$log2FoldChange, res$padj)
```

Take to log of the P-value
```{r}
plot(res$log2FoldChange, log(res$padj))
```

```{r}
log(0.01)
```
```{r}
log(0.0000000001)
```
We can just flip that y-axis by putting a minus sigh on it

```{r}
plot(res$log2FoldChange, -log(res$padj),
     xlab="Log2 Fold-change",
     ylab="-log(P-value)")
```

Let's save our work to date

```{r}
write.csv(res, file="myresults.csv")
```

To finish off let's make a nicer volcano plot

- Add the log2 threshold lines at +2/-2
- Add P-value threshold lines at 0.05
- Add color to highlight the subset of genes that meet both of the above thresholds (pick your favoriate color).

Make it with ggplot please...

```{r}
mycols <- rep("gray", nrow(res))
mycols[res$log2FoldChange >= 2 ] <- "blue"
mycols[res$log2FoldChange <= -2] <- "blue"
mycols[res$padj > 0.05] <- "gray"
```

```{r}
myalpha <- rep(0.6, , nrow(res))
myalpha[res$log2FoldChange >= 2 ] <- 1
myalpha[res$log2FoldChange <= -2] <- 1
myalpha[res$padj > 0.05] <- 0.6
```


```{r}
#| warning: false

ggplot(res) +
  aes(log2FoldChange, -log(padj)) +
  geom_point(col=mycols, alpha=myalpha) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = c(-2,2), col="red") +
  geom_hline(yintercept = -log(0.05), col="red") +
  labs(title="Volcano Plot")
```

## Add gene annotation data

Now the question is what are the blue points in the above volcano plot - i.e. what are the genes most influenced by drug treatment here?

```{r}
head(res)
```

We will use some BioConductor packages to "map" the ENSEMBLE ids to more useful gene SYMBOL names/ids.

We can install these packages with:
`BiocManager::install("AnnotationDbi")`

```{r}
library(AnnotationDbi)
library(org.Hs.eg.db)
```
What database identifiers can I translate between here:

```{r}
columns(org.Hs.eg.db)
```
We can now use the `mapIDs()` function to translate/map between these different identifier formats.

Let's add SYMBOL, GENENAME and ENTREZID
```{r}
res$symbol <- mapIds(org.Hs.eg.db,
                     keys=rownames(res),
                     keytype = "ENSEMBL",
                     column = "SYMBOL")

res$genename <- mapIds(org.Hs.eg.db,
                     keys=rownames(res),
                     keytype = "ENSEMBL",
                     column = "GENENAME")

res$entrez <- mapIds(org.Hs.eg.db,
                     keys=rownames(res),
                     keytype = "ENSEMBL",
                     column = "ENTREZID")
  
head(res)
```


## Pathway analysis

Now I know the gene names and their IDs in different databases I want to know what type of biology they are involved in...

This is the job of "pathway analysis" (a.k.a. "gene set enrichment")

There are tones of different BioConductor packages for pathway analysis here we use just one of them called **gage** and **pathview**. I will install these packages with `BiocManager::install(c("gage","pathview", "gageData"))`

```{r}
library(gage)
library(gageData)
library(pathview)
```

Load up the KEGG genesets
```{r}
data(kegg.sets.hs)
```

```{r}
head(kegg.sets.hs, 2)
```

We will use these KEGG genesets (a.k.a. pathways) and our `res` results to see what overlaps. To do this we will use the `gage()` function.

For input `gage()` wants just a vector of importance - in our case FoldChange values.

```{r}
foldchanges <- res$log2FoldChange
```

Vectors in R can have "names" that are useful for bookkeeping so we know what a given value corresponds to, e.g.

```{r}

x <- c(10, 100, 20)
names(x) <- c("barry", "alice", "chandra")
x
```
Let's put names on our `foldchanges` vector - here we will use `res$entrez`

```{r}
names(foldchanges) <- res$entrez
head(foldchanges)
```

Now we can run "pathway analysis"
```{r}
# Get the results
keggres = gage(foldchanges, gsets=kegg.sets.hs)
```

```{r}
head(keggres$less)
```

We can get a pathway image file with our genesets highlighted via the `pathview()` function.

```{r}
pathview(foldchanges, pathway.id = "hsa05310")
```
Insert this figure in my report
